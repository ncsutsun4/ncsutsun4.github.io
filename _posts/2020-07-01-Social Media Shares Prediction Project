outlining your project
linking to the username.github.io/repo-name site. 

Some thoughts about this project:

• what would you do differently?


• what was the most difficult part for you?


• what are your big take-aways from this project?






In [**Chirpy**](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/), the image files of [Favicons](https://www.favicon-generator.org/about/) are placed in `assets/img/favicons/`. You may need to replace them with your own. So let's see how to customize these Favicons.

With a square image (PNG, JPG or GIF) in hand, open the site [*Favicon & App Icon Generator*](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) and upload your original image.

![upload-image]({{ "/assets/img/sample/upload-image.png" | relative_url }})

Click button <kbd>Create Favicon</kbd> and wait a moment for the website to generate the icons of various sizes automatically.

![download-icons]({{ "/assets/img/sample/download-icons.png" | relative_url }})

Download the generated package, unzip and delete the following two from the extracted files:

- browserconfig.xml
- manifest.json
 
Now, copy the rest image files (`.PNG` and `.ICO`) to cover the original one in folder `assets/img/favicons/`.

Lastly, don't forget to rebuild your site so that the icon becomes your custom edition.
