This project involves creating predictive models and automating Markdown documents. The [output can be found **here**](https://ncsutsun4.github.io/sunproject2/).

Project Outline:
 1. Exploratory data analysis.
 2. Subset data from **Monday** and split data into training and testing sets.
 3. Fit linear regression model with the training set and make prediction with testing set.
 4. Fit random forest model with the training set and make prediction with testing set.
 5. Compare two model prediction accurate rate.
 7. Create github markdown file output.
 8. Automation the process of 1-7 for **each day** of the week.
 9. Create a readme file including all output links.

Some thoughts about this project:

• what would you do differently?
 I think I will reduce sample size while going through the process, because training random forest caused so much time when given large dataset.

• what was the most difficult part for you?
 The most difficult part is how to select best linear model for the prediction because there are so many variables. I also do not know how well my model to be judge as "good". 

• what are your big take-aways from this project?
 Generally speaking, random forest model works better than linear regression model for prediction purpose.
