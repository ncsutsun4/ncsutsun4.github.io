Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites).  
What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?

I had taken ST555 (SAS programming), and I think comparing to SAS R is:
  * Much more flexiable and easy to use syntax-wise, sometime I use R as a calculator for homeworks. 
  * R is more compacted, it only take several hundreds MB of space comparing to >10GB of SAS.

What functionality do you like about R?  
  * Extensibility, I installed R markdown/Latex for my homework, it makes homework much easier and looks much better.

What parts do you miss about your other language?  
  * R sometime will give ambiguous error message, it will make programmign in R more easier if the error message could be more specific to the point. 

Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)
  * R is easier for beginners, but it will become more difficult when I have to learn and remember different syntax from different packages, so learning tidyverse package in this course is a very good experience for me.
