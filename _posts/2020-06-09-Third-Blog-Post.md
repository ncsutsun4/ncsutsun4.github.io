# First vignette project

## Project description and findings
This project is to create a vignette (an HTML file with a table of contents) about reading JSON data and exploring it. I found that Montr√©al Canadiens is one of the teams with top winning ratio in all games, and Edmonton Oilers performed much better in playoffs than in regular seasons.

## Reflections
* what would you do differently?
  I am not familar with NHL, if I had enough time to learn more about NHL game rules and history, I think I will do much better analysis and find more interesting relationships between variables.
  
* what was the most difficult part for you?
  Try to find the best variables to perform the analsis is the most difficult part for me because I do not know exactly some variables' meaning. Alos try to knit into github_document is also very difficult, the knit settings and the ouput displays not as expected as for knit into HTML in local machine, later I tried to change all my "datatable" function to "kabble" to solve my knit problem. I think "datatable" might not supported by github md.
  
* what are your big take-aways from this project?
  I am glad that I learned some basic knowledge about JSON format and how to process JSON files from this project. Also I am realizing that R can do so many different jobs and there are so many I need to learn about R. Most improtantly, I learned how to do version control in R using git and github.
