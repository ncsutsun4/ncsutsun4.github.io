**ST 558 Course refecection**

1. How is the course going so far?  

Everything goes well with this course for me. 

2. What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?

This course covers some basics about R, many of my confusions about R (conceptually and technically) while taking 501 and 502 has been 
solved by taking this course. I also find that R can do so many different jobs that I have never heard or never had the opportunity 
to try, like the git version control, acquiring information from website through API.


3. Any other thoughts?  (I just like to hear how everyone is doing and get feedback to incorporate!

I do not have other thoughts and am eager to learn more about what R can do.
