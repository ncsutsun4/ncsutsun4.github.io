Update my thoughts on R.

1. what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?
  My initinal post about data scientist " 1. Generate dataset or clean high-dimentional data for analysis and prediction purpose.  2. Test different models to find the best one for the data."
  Now, I think what data scientists are doing is quite different from traditional statisticians. Data scientists are more focused on building prediction models and trying to achieve better prediction without considering too much about model's interpretability. Also, I found that data science field is quite 'hot' now and you can find a lot posts or articles to introduce their work.

2. what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
  After taking this course, I found that R is very powerful and actually can do all the work as Python. I will continue to use R for my own projects if possible. The only concern is that a lot of data scientist jobs are requiring Python programming skills. To survive in the data science field, I think one need to learn Python too.

3. what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
  I think the skills of doing version control with git and sharking work on github are the most useful skills I learned from this course. I think I will continue to do that.
