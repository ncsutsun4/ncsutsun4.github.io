title: A Simple Shinny App for Modeling Pitcher Data
---

The gitbub repo [URL!](https://github.com/ncsutsun4/project3). You may also run the App locally using RStudio by running command " library(shiny); shiny::runGitHub('project3', 'ncsutsun4', subdir='pitchers') " on your console.

A R shiny App for analyzing Pitchf/x data is generated. One may use linear regression and logistic regression to predict baseball run distance and whehter the baseball is a fast ball or not. 

I used a R shiny example as template for this APP, the difficulty part for me is to find the best "questions" for the model. I think I will keep optimizing this App later to make more reasonable models.
